Streamlit Chatbot with SQL Database Access (using Gemini by Google)

**Introduction:**

This project provides a user-friendly chatbot interface built with Streamlit and leverages the power of Gemini, a large language model by Google, for natural language interactions. It allows users to connect and interact with a SQL database, empowering them to retrieve and potentially manipulate information.

**Features:**

- **Chatbot Interface:** Engage in interactive conversations with the chatbot using text input.
- **SQL Database Integration:** Connect to a specified SQL database to access and manage data.

**Getting Started:**

Before you begin, ensure you have Python and Git installed on your system.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired project directory. Then, run the following command to clone this repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git
   ```

   Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<your-repository-name>` with the actual name of your repository.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   - **Using `venv` (Python 3.3+):**
     ```bash
     cd <your-repository-name>
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
     ```
   - **Using `conda` (if available):**
     ```bash
     conda create -p venv python=x.y.z  # Replace x.y.z with your desired Python version
     conda activate venv
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Activate your virtual environment (if created). Then, install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Database Connection (Optional):**
   - If you have a pre-existing SQL database:
     1. Modify the connection details in the variable `db_path` with your database path.
     2. Make sure your database server is accessible from your machine.
   - If you want to use the `sales.py` script for a sample database:
     Run `python sales.py` to create an example database within your project directory.

5. **Generate and Store API Key:**

This project requires an API key to interact with the Gemini model from Google AI Studio.

Visit https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey to create a new API key.

Important: Keep your API key secure!

Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project with the following line, replacing <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual key:

```bash
API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

**Running the Chatbot:**

Start the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   A browser window will open automatically, displaying the chatbot interface.

**Using the Chatbot:**

Interact with the chatbot by typing your questions or commands. The chatbot will leverage Gemini's capabilities to understand your intent and potentially access data from the connected database, if configured.

**Additional Notes:**

- For first-time users of Python, virtual environments are highly recommended to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other applications on your system.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation for the individual libraries used in this project (Streamlit, Gemini, your SQL client library).

**Further Development:**

- Customize the chatbot behavior by modifying the logic within the `app.py` file.
- Enhance the user experience with additional features like data visualization, form-based interaction, or more sophisticated database operations.

**Disclaimer:**

This README file provides a general guide for using the project. The specific implementation details may vary depending on your unique database setup, API requirements, and desired functionalities.

I hope this comprehensive README file empowers you to effectively use your Streamlit chatbot project!
